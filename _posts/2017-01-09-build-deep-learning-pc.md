title: Build a PC for Deep Learning
tags: machine-learning
---

Deep learning is hot, it is all over the news, hacker news, that is.

After some research I am convinced deep learning was not just some fad, it is the real deal, I decided to build a new PC for deep learning. (But really, just an excuse I gave myself for replacing my perfectly fine 3 year old PC.)

Here is the part list:

The reason I choose this combination of CPU/motherboard is the potential to have 4 graphic cards installed on the motherboard.  Core i7-5930K has 40 PCIe lanes that supports 4 GPUs. Gigabyte X99-UD4 has 4 evenly spaced PCIe slots.  The PSU I got-EVGA 1600w should be more than enough to support 4 GPUs. Is is unlikely I will need 4 graphic cards, but the potential is there.

I got all parts in China and over-paid roughly 15% compared to US, which is funny because almost all of these were assembled in China.

No, I did not do a good job of cable management.

This thing is huuuge, here show the size comparison with a regular mid tower.
