[apeflac2mp3](https://github.com/wensheng/apeflac2mp3) is a Python script I wrote to bulk convert APE, FLAC or other music files to mp3.

I have a lot of musics in APE and FLAC formats, for example this gem: `Mozart Complete Works [Brilliant] 170 CDs`.  It has 170 FLAC files, one for each CD. Each FLAC file also have a `cue` file that tells title and start time for every tracks in the FLAC file.

Convert them manually will take a lot of time.  I'm sure there are bulk converters for this type of task, but I just could not find any.  So I wrote it.  It basically use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) to do the conversion.  The bulk of cue parsing code is from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/bancek/b37b780292540ed2d17d).

With it, I converted 170 CD Mozart library to a directory that contains 2215 MP3 files. The size of original FLAC files is 42GB, it was reduced to 8GB in MP3 format.

For `Chopin The Complete Works 16CD`, I got 258 MP3 files with a total size of only 1GB.
