These is a post on HN today about ["Replacing Disqus with GitHub Comments"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14170041).  I had Diqus, I forgot why it stopped working or I just never enabled it in the first place.  So I took this opportunity to add comment to this blog, using the method suggested in that post.

I also removed swiftype search.  It worked for a while then stopped, I did not try to find out why either.  Now except for js CDN, this blog has no other outside dependencies than Github itself.  This makes maintainence simpler.
