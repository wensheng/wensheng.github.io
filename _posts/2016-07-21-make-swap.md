title: Creating Swap File
---

I ordered a ECS from Aliyun, it come without a (virtual) swap drive. Here are the steps to create one:

```bash
    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=2
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
    sudo mkswap /swapfile
    sudo swapon /swapfile
```

A 2G swap space is created and activated.  To make it available at next reboot: `sudo vi /etc/fstab`

add this:

    /swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0
