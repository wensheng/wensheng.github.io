Even though I promised myself I would blog more, I just cant think of what to blog.

I learned a lot lately, but putting them in writings in a coherent manner is quite a challenge.

These days my minds seems scattered around all over the places, there is clearly lack of focus and even priorities.  I really should be taking a pause from time to time and regroup myself.

OK, why not do that right NOW.
