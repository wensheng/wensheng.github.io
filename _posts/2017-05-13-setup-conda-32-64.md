I need to have both 32 bit and 64 bit Python on my Windows machine.  For 32 bit, I only need Python 2.  

First, I installed Anaconda 4.3 into my home directory (C:\Users\wensheng).  Then I downloaded [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) Python 2.7 32-bit installer.  I run the installer as usual, but at the last step, where it ask if you want to add path to environment, uncheck that option.

So now I have both 32 bit and 64 bit Anaconda installed, 32-bit is in `Miniconda2`, 64-bit is in `Anaconda3`, both under `C:\Users\wensheng`.  But I only have path for 64-bit in my environment.  When I type `python`, `conda`, or `activate` in cmd.exe, I get 64-bit version. 

To create a 32-bit conda env, I use full name of 32-bit conda, like:

`C:\Users\wensheng\Miniconda2\Scripts\conda create -n ...`

Because this is done only once or twice so it's not that painful.  However once conda env is created, I do use activate quite often.  But typing just `activate` in cmd.exe will invoke the 64-bit Python 3 version.  To make it easier to run 32-bit `activate`, I create a bat file in my bin directory called act.bat with just one line:

    %USERPROFILE%\Miniconda2\Scripts\activate %1

Now `act` is for 32-bit `activate`.  (My `bin` directory is already in my PATH environment variable.)

Side note: On linux, when you run just `env`, it will print out all environment variables.  On Windows, the equivalent is typing just `set`.
