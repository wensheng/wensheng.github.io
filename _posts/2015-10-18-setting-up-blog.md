I set up this blog using Github Pages today.

I actually had a blog, but it's hosted on Google's Blogger, which is not accessable in China. I spend the majority of my time in China now, even though I can access the blog with VPN, it's still inconvinient.  That's why I set up this blog.  

~~I hope~~ I promise myself I will write more blog posts than I used to.

The theme for this blog is from [Here](https://github.com/dubuyuye/blog) by <http://blog.rainyalley.com/>

The steps for setting up this blog are in the repo <https://github.com/wensheng/wensheng.github.io> [steps.md](https://github.com/wensheng/wensheng.github.io/blob/master/steps.md)
